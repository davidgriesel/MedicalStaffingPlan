# Medical Staffing Plan
## Overview
The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. It can range from mild to severe and, in some cases, lead to death. While anyone can get the flu, certain groups are at higher risk of developing serious complications. These include adults over 65 and children under five. The most effective way to prevent influenza is through annual vaccination, especially for those in vulnerable populations.

In the United States, there is an annual surge in flu cases, leading to an increase in hospitalisations due to severe complications. During this time, hospitals and clinics often require additional staff to manage the increased number of patients, and medical staffing agencies help meet this demand by providing temporary healthcare professionals.

## Goals
To inform the timing and spatial distribution of a medical agency’s staffing plan by analysing historical influenza and demographic data.

## Scope
The plan prepares for the upcoming 2018 season and covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States.

## Objectives
### Spatial Distribution & Risk Classification
Identify and prioritise states with large vulnerable populations by categorising them as low, medium, or high risk based on population size.
### Seasonality & Forecasting
Assess whether influenza follows a seasonal pattern and, if so, determine whether its onset and duration remain consistent across states each year in order to forecast trends for the upcoming season.

## Key Questions
### Spatial distribution & Risk Classification
- Does the severity of influenza vary?
- Who suffers most?
- Does population size have an impact?
- Where are vulnerable populations located?
- How does population size translate to risk?
### Seasonality & Forecasting
- When is influenza most prevalent?

## Tools & Techniques
Excel - Data Preparation | Statistical Analysis | Hypothesis Testing
Tableau - Visualisation | Storytelling

## Data
The following datasets from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Census Bureau were used that cover the period 2009 to 2017:
### Number of influenza-related deaths
Number of deaths by location, time, and age. (CDC)
### Influenza vaccination rates in children
Number of vaccinations by location, time, and age. (CDC)
### Population
Number of people by location, time, age, and gender. (US Census Bureau)
